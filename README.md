## ABOUT

Eluna is a Lua Engine for World of Warcraft emulators. Our main site is [Emudevs] (http://emudevs.com). Eluna's team is working hard to support other emulators rather than just one. MaNGOS is supporting us and they're updating the MaNGOS source to work for their emulator. 


We want to be the major Lua source for World of Warcraft emulation. If you need help regarding methods, hooks and other wiki related documentation, go to [Eluna's Wiki](http://wiki.emudevs.com/doku.php?id=eluna).

## MORE INFORMATION

If you'd like to use Eluna with MaNGOS, look further down this README for the links to it. However, if you prefer Eluna with TrinityCore, you can download and keep updated with our standalone source here, or go to [Eluna WotLK TC] (https://github.com/ElunaLuaEngine/Eluna-TC-Wotlk) for our forked source of TrinityCore with Eluna in it.
